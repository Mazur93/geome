# Geome - a Geometry Library in Rust
I am a python developer starting to learn Rust. This project is done to get my hands dirty. It is not meant for production use and comes with no warranty.

# Scope
This library will provide 2D geometry functionality (3D might be added in the future) 

## Geometric Data Types
The following geometric data types will be supported:
- Point (DONE)
- Line (in progress)
- Polygon (TODO)

## Functionalities
The following functionalities will be included 
- distance between objects (in progress)
- intersection between polygons (TODO)
- within (TODO)
- centroid (TODO)
- interpolate a point along line (TODO)
- create geometric data types from WKT (well-known text) (in progress)
- distance matrix for points (DONE)
- (k) nearest neighbor (TODO)
- point grid creation (TODO)
